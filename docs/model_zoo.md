## VM4A

VM4A provides from-scratch visuomotor baselines that use StarVLA's shared data, normalization, training, and deployment interfaces. See [VM4A: VisuoMotor for Action](VM4A.md) for configuration and implementation details.

| Model | Description | Checkpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ACT** | LeRobot ACTPolicy wrapper for direct image-and-state action chunking | real-robot validated; public checkpoint TBD per maintainer discussion |
| **Diffusion Policy** | Vendored non-hybrid image policy with a ResNet-18 encoder and DDPM action generation | real-robot validated; public checkpoint TBD per maintainer discussion |
