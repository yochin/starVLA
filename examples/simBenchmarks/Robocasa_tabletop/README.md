# 🚀 Robocasa-GR1-Tabletop-Tasks Evaluation

This document provides instructions for reproducing our **experimental results** with [robocasa-gr1-tabletop-tasks](https://github.com/robocasa/robocasa-gr1-tabletop-tasks).  
The evaluation process consists of two main parts:  

1. Setting up the `robocasa` environment and dependencies.  
2. Running the evaluation by launching services in both `starVLA` and `robocasa` environments.  

We have verified that this workflow runs successfully on **NVIDIA A100** GPUs.

## ⬇️ 0. Download Checkpoints
First, download the checkpoints from 
- [Qwen3VL-GR00T](https://huggingface.co/StarVLA/Qwen3-VL-GR00T-Robocasa-gr1)
- [Qwen3VL-OFT](https://huggingface.co/StarVLA/Qwen3-VL-OFT-Robocasa)

## 📦 1. Environment Setup

To set up the environment, please first follow the [official RoboCasa installation guide](https://github.com/robocasa/robocasa-gr1-tabletop-tasks?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to install the base `robocasa-gr1-tabletop-tasks` environment.  

than pip soceket support

'''bash
pip install tyro
'''

## 🚀 2. Evaluation Workflow

### Step 1. Start the server (starVLA environment)

In the first terminal, activate the `starVLA` conda environment and run:  

```bash
python deployment/model_server/server_policy.py \
        --ckpt_path ${your_ckpt} \
        --port 5678 \
        --use_bf16
```

---

### Step 2. Start the simulation (robocasa environment)

In the second terminal, activate the `robocasa` conda environment and run:  

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):${PYTHONPATH}
your_ckpt=StarVLA/Qwen3-VL-OFT-Robocasa/checkpoints/steps_90000_pytorch_model.pt

python examples/simBenchmarks/Robocasa_tabletop/eval_files/simulation_env.py\
   --args.env_name ${env_name} \
   --args.port 5678 \
   --args.n_episodes 50 \
   --args.n_envs 1 \
   --args.max_episode_steps 720 \
   --args.n_action_steps 12 \
   --args.no_send_state \
   --args.video_out_path ${video_out_path} \
   --args.pretrained_path ${your_ckpt}
```

⚠️ **Note on the state input:** use `--args.no_send_state` for the **Qwen3VL-OFT** checkpoint, which takes only language + image as input — when a `state` key is present, QwenOFT appends discretized state tokens to the instruction, deviating from the training-time prompt format (see issue #355 for measurements). For the **Qwen3VL-GR00T** checkpoint, keep the default (state enabled): its action head consumes the state input.

If your checkpoint's `dataset_statistics.json` contains multiple keys, select the embodiment with `--args.unnorm_key <key>` (e.g. `gr1`). With a single key (both released checkpoints), it is auto-selected.

### Optional: Batch Evaluation

If you have more GPU, you can use the batch evaluation script:
```bash
bash examples/simBenchmarks/Robocasa_tabletop/eval_files/batch_eval_args.sh
```
⚠️ **Note:** Please ensure that you specify the correct checkpoint path in `batch_eval_args.sh`. The fifth argument is forwarded to `simulation_env.py` and defaults to `--args.no_send_state` (matching the default Qwen3VL-OFT checkpoint); pass `""` when evaluating the Qwen3VL-GR00T checkpoint.

# 🚀 Reproduce Training Results
## 📦 Step0: Download the training dataset
Download the PhysicalAI-Robotics-GR00T-X-Embodiment-Sim directory datasets from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/PhysicalAI-Robotics-GR00T-X-Embodiment-Sim) to the playground/Datasets/nvidia/PhysicalAI-Robotics-GR00T-X-Embodiment-Sim directory

To download only the relevant finetuning folders, you can refer [GR00T-N1.5](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T/tree/4af2b622892f7dcb5aae5a3fb70bcb02dc217b96/examples/RoboCasa#-1-dataset-preparation) repo's instruction. 
Or using the script download the *_1000 folders.

```bash
python examples/simBenchmarks/Robocasa_tabletop/download_gr00t_ft_data.py
```

## 🚀 Step1: Start Training
Different datasets can be selected by modifying the parameter `data_mix`, and the following script can be used to fine-tune the `*_1000` datasets:
```bash
bash examples/simBenchmarks/Robocasa_tabletop/train_files/run_robocasa.sh
```
